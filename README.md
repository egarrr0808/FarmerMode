# FarmerMode
FarmerMode is a Minecraft Paper plugin for version 1.21.4 that allows players with the “farmer” role to enable a special mode with increased monster spawn rates. This plugin includes a voting system that requires 75% approval from players to activate farm mode, and displays the current server mode in the tab list.
